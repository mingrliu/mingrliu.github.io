HONOR CODE: 
Please see the Office for Academic Integrity (https://oai.gmu.edu/) for a full description of the code and the honor committee process, and the Honor Code Policies of the Department of Computer Science (https://cs.gmu.edu/resources/honor-code/) regarding the course project. GMU is an Honor Code university. The principle of academic integrity is taken seriously and violations are treated gravely. If you rely on someone else's work in an aspect of the course project, you should give full credit in the proper, accepted      form. Another aspect of academic integrity is the free play of ideas. Vigorous discussion and debate are encouraged in this course, with the firm expectation that all aspects of the class will be conducted with civility and respect for differing ideas, perspectives, and traditions. When in doubt (of any kind) please ask for guidance and clarification.
